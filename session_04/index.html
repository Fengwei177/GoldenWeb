        <br>

    <p>Miao Ying was born in Shanghai, China. She studied at Chinese Academy of Fine arts and Alfred University.</p>
    <p>Miao's art focuses on Chinese internet culture and <a href="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/5074/production/_96969502_78b75efc-37fe-449f-944e-0fa30805a597.jpg">censorship</a>, as well as how contemporary technology</p>
    <p>influence our daily lives. Many of her works use parodies and humor to give viewers a glimpse of what the</p>
    <p>internet is like inside the great fire wall, and how unique culture and memes develop under government</P>
    <p>censorship and self-censorship.</p>    
        <br>
    <p>Miao's Blind Spot (2007) is a manually annotated Mandarin dictionary. These annotation are the 2000 censored</P>
    <p>search terms on google.cn at that time. Miao spent three month searching all words in the dictionary from A to</p>
    <p>Z, finding the 2000 censored terms and erasing them in the dictionary using white tape. The work comments on</p>
    <p>heavy censorship on Chinese internet and the human labor to enforce such strict regulations.</p>
