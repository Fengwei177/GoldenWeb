            <p>I was born in Dalian, a city in northeast China. I have interest in 
                art when I was young, and I went to a middle school in Dalian that
                specialize in traditional drawing and painting. In 2013, I moved to 
                the United States and went to an international high school in Boston.
                I continued to make art and used my skills to service my schoolâ€™s various 
                clubs and organizations. I then moved to Chicago for college in School 
                of the Art Institute of Chicago where I learned many contemporary design 
                styles and cultures.

            <p>In design cultures, I am specifically interested in vexillology, which is 
                the study of flags. I enjoy studying flag designs because through these 
                designs I can learn about the history and cultural aspects of visual symbols. 
                I also enjoy science fiction, I enjoy reading hard sci-fi books and the infinitely 
                grand imagination they offer.
