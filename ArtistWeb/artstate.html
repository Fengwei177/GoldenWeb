            <p>Minutes after I was born, my doctor came to the realization that 
                there was a problem; they informed my parents that I was born with 
                a severe heart condition that could significantly affect the rest 
                of my childhood. My health issue left me struggling with constant illness. 
                During my grade school years, I was always the one who was unable 
                to be with friends on the playground, who always needed an excuse 
                during sports activities, who had to sit aside while the others 
                enjoyed running and jumping without losing breath and feeling the 
                painful struggle of a scarred heart trying to function.

        <div class="container6">
            <p> I spent my free time alone, drawing and doodling. It was my only 
                interest other than sitting aside and watching others playing, l
                aughing, and chatting. Drawing was just a way for me to pass some time. 
                It eventually became a habit, and I enjoyed sketching and painting.
                 As I completed more drawings, and displayed them for my parents 
                 and teachers, they began to see my potential, and were surprised 
                 that I could draw so well for a nine year old. They quickly recognized 
                 my talent in art. Art became a way for me to present my unique 
                 perception of the world, and to picture my ideas about the topics 
                 that interested me the most. I enjoyed putting my thoughts into a 
                 visual presentation, and expressing them in a creative and conceptual way.

        <div class="container7">
            <p> After my parents and teachers recognized my talent, I decided to take my 
                art to a professional level. I started to attend classes to study the 
                ideology of art and focusing on my training of artistic skills. Through a 
                series of courses, the demand of quality and quantity of my works vastly increased, 
                and I found the lessons to be more and more difficult. Many of my classmates gave up 
                because they thought the endless practicing was tedious and frustrating, and they 
                did not see improvements as quickly as they expected. I, however, did not give up, 
                for I know improvements do not come quickly or easily, they happen gradually through 
                each piece of work. Studying art is to practice, make mistakes, learn from them and 
                gain experience, then put the knowledge learned from previous experience into the next piece. 
                It is a long-term process that takes patience, effort, and time. I learned that my improvement 
                from one piece to another is not significant, but it is each step of slim improvement from piece 
                to piece and large amount of devotion and practice that can build up my gradual but solid, significant 
                progress. I became a patient learner and took on more challenges; I took the steps and devoted efforts 
                by contributing my careful attention of learned onto each proceeding piece. I would spend countless 
                hours practicing and building my skills, without ever giving up. My patience and devotion paid off: 
                I was able to attend one of the best professional art middle schools in my home country, 
                China, and received an advance education to build my skills and study valuable knowledge. Later, 
                I decided to study abroad to further pursue my art career and continue to study art, create art, 
                and take on new challenges and higher goals.
